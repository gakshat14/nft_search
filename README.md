### Starting local server

```
npm install && expo start
```

this will open a browser with the metro bundler which then can be used to run application on a browser, or on an android device using expo go application.

### Functionality completed

1. Able to search for all ERC-721 tokens associated with a wallet
2. Able to fetch all the tokens associated with a contract address
3. Able to display images part of the token on the browser.

### TODO

1. Provide a fix for Application crashing on Android (I suspect its the web scraping library.)
2. Use APIs to retrieve metadata for a token instead of scraping
3. Make UI more intuitive
4. Add validation
5. Cover edge cases

### Learning outcome

Blockchain is quite complex, but it was a ride. I also got a little bit of hands on elixir. Making react native application has its own set of disadvantages and it would require more time to study the best practices as well to learn more about components. The task was easy but constraints were difficult. Interacting with 2 completely new systems and that too in 8 hours.
